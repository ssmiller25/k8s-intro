## Incorporating Development Practices in Operations

 [Steve Miller](https://www.r15cookie.com) 

- Devops Practioner
- Sr. Systems Engineer at Plex Systems (Not **that** Plex...)

<!--s-->

## Goal

How can operations leverage useful tools and techniques from Development groups to become more Agile

<aside class="notes">
  - Focus on Agility.  HOw to become "cloud-like" without necessarily leveraging cloud
  - Notice not calling this "DevOps".  A far larger topic that generally involves having a far deeper connection between operatiosn and production.
